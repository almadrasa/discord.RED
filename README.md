## ARCHIVE NOTICE
As of January 15th, 2022, this project has been archived. Don't worry though, because I'm working on a much cooler and extensive project that won't only target Discord, but *everything*. So, in the future, many features of this repository may be half-working or completely broken. When I *do* end up publishing the project I spoke about earlier, it'll be accessable through [this](https://github.com/13-05/redpoint) link.

## Features
1) Discord Token Bruteforcer
2) Discord Token Login
3) UserID Lookup
4) Webhook Spammer
5) Custom Status Message
6) Red Selfbot [(not fully implemented yet, but it's there)](https://13-05.github.io/dsc.red/commands)
7) Token Invalidator (acc disabler)

## About
this project was thought up shortly after i created [this](https://github.com/13-05/disc-python-hacks) repo, and dsc.RED's end goal is to exploit every weakness exposed in the latter.
