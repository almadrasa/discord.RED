## TODO
- [x] Red Selfbot (being worked on now!!)
- [x] UserID Lookup
- [x] Webhook Spammer
- [x] Custom Status Message (RPC?)
- [x] Token Invalidator (acc disabler)
- [ ] Token Grabber/Token Grabber Generator
- [ ] Token Checker (checks if a token is valid, then gives you information about it)
###### Webhook URL Bruteforcer *is pointless as even an idea now imo*, and Message Logger *can be compacted into the red selfbot imo.*

## About
this project was thought up shortly after i created [this](https://github.com/13-05/disc-python-hacks) repo, and dsc.RED's end goal is to exploit every weakness exposed in the latter.
